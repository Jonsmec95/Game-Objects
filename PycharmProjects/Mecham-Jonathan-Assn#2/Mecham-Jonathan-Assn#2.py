	I learned quite a bit from this article on Computer Science. First of all, I had no idea that it was such a controversial subject and had so many objections. It made me think that with all these objectives against it, it is obviously a new subject or science that needs to be explored even further. There are is so much potential in the science that can be used to help the world around us. Just like any other science or subject out there, it is always expanding as new scientists discover new understandings. I liked how this article compared computers as instruments. I think thatâ€™s exactly what they are. They are tools to help elevate the quality of life in any circumstance.

	This article talks about a group of researchers who developed a software tool that uses algorithms to predict landslide boundaries up to two weeks before they happen. I love that computer science can be applied to anything and anywhere. That is one of the things I look forward to the most about majoring in Computer Science. That the possibilities of careers I could do are enless.
