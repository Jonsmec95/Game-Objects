1) requirement specs
    - user enters two x,y points
    - print distance between the two points, use abs() so its positive

2) calculate the distance between the two points using distance formula

3)
input point x1,y1
input point x2,y2

import math
distance = abs(sqrt(x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1)**2))
